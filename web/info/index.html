<h1>About this site</h1>

<p>This site provides geodata derived from OpenStreetMap data, processed for
easier use for rendering maps and other purposes.</p>

<p>There are several download options on this site. See the information about
available <a href="/info/projections.html">projections</a> and <a
href="/info/formats.html">formats</a>.  All data available here is updated regularly
based on the latest changes in OpenStreetMap using <a
href="/processing/">processing techniques</a> developed by us and using <a
href="/processing/software.html">Open Source software</a>.</p>

<h2>Data</h2>

<p>All of the data on this site is derived from the original <a
href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> data and is available
under open licenses. See the <a href="/info/license.html">license page</a> for
more details.</p>

<p>Because the data is directly derived from OpenStreetMap data, errors in OSM
data will appear in this data, too. Don't ask us to fix those errors, you can
do that in OpenStreetMap yourself.</p>

<p>You can get the original OpenStreetMap data from the official download site at
