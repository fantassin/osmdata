<h1>Coastline processing</h1>


<h2>The coastline in OSM</h2>

<p>The coastline is handled somewhat differently than most other features in
OSM. To mark it ways with the tag <tt>natural=coastline</tt> are used. Those
ways need to connect end-to-end to form an unbroken line around every island
and every continent. And the land always has to be on the left side, the water
on the right side of those ways. For details see the
<a class="extlink"
href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:natural=coastline">OSM wiki</a>.


<h2>Processing with OSMCoastline</h2>

<p>The world is big and all the coastlines together are very very long. So
there is a lot of data. And chances are that at any moment someone somewhere
is updating the coastline. And that is not always easy to do, and errors happen.
But we need one unbroken line to form proper (multi)polygons of land masses
(or the sea). Specifically for this task we have developed the <a class="extlink"
href="https://osmcode.org/osmcoastline/">OSMCoastline</a> program. It assembles
all the data, applies some fixes if necessary and creates the data you see on
this site. For more of the inner workings refer to the OSMCoastline
documentation or have a look at <a class="extlink"
href="https://blog.jochentopf.com/tags-osmcoastline.html">these blog
posts</a>. OSMCoastline has many parameters and options and you can run it
yourself to create specialized output if what you see on this site is not
enough for your use case.</p>


<h2>Finding and fixing errors</h2>

<p>As the OSMCoastline program runs to create the coastline, it will report any
errors in the coastline it finds. This information is then sent on to the
<a class="extlink"
href="https://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=coastline">Coastline view of the
Geofabrik OSM Inspector</a>. You can help fixing the OSM data by checking
that site and correcting any errors you see. Thanks to all the OSM users who
do this!</p>

<p class="tip">If you can't find an error shown by the OSM Inspector in your
OSM editor, chances are somebody else was faster and has already fixed it!</p>
