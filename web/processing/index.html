<h1>Processing</h1>

<p>OpenStreetMap data in its raw form is often hard to use. The goal of this
site is to give you access to pre-processed OSM data in a convenient form. But
we can not create the data in every form that might be needed, so we give you
the background information and the software to do it yourself.</p>

<a href="/processing/coastline.html" class="option">
    <h2>Coastlines</h2>
    <p>Coastlines are recorded in OSM using the tag <tt>natural=coastline</tt>.
    Our coastline processing finds all ways with that tag and stitches them
    together while correcting small errors.</p>
</a>

<a href="/processing/icesheet.html" class="option">
    <h2>Icesheet</h2>
    <p>Antarctic icesheets are handled specially: Instead of tagging the ice
    sheets, the area in the Antarctic that does <i>not</i> contain any ice is
    tagged. Our processing takes this into account when creating icesheet
    outlines and polygons.</p>

<a href="/processing/generalization.html" class="option">
    <h2>Generalization</h2>
    <p>OpenStreetMap data is amazingly detailed. But for small scale maps (small
    zoom levels) this detail is not needed, or worse, cluttering up the map. Our
    generalized data removes the detail for nicer looking overview maps.</p>
</a>

<a href="/processing/water.html" class="option">
    <h2>Waterbodies</h2>
    <p>Waterbody data in OpenStreetMap has a very large volume so for rendering
    small scale maps (small zoom levels) we offer a reduced, more compact version
    of this that allows rendering the global waterbodies in an efficient way
    at these scales.</p>

    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>All the software we base our processing on is Open Source. Feel free
    to use it, learn from it, and change it.</p>
