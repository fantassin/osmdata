<h1>Information on generalization</h1>

<img class="right" src="/img/generalization_z0.png" width="256" height="256" title="Coastline rendering at z=0" />

<p>Most OpenStreetMap-based maps are rendered from exactly the same data on all
scales. This means that at low zoom levels there is usually way too much
geometric detail which produces a lot of noise and blurriness in the results by
rendering details that cannot be properly represented at the map scale and
resolution used.</p>

<p>The process of adapting the detailed map data as it has been surveyed to the
target map scale and resolution is called <em>cartographic generalization</em>.
This is neglected in most digital zoomable maps. Key to good quality
generalization and ultimately clear and well readable maps is the elimination
of unimportant details that cannot be properly shown and at the same time
selection and emphasis of key elements. This is not to be confused with mere
geometric simplification which is just one element of generalization and which
is widely used in digital map production.</p>

<h2>Generalized coastlines</h2>

<p>We provide a generalized version of the
<a href="/processing/coastline.html">OpenStreetMap coastlines</a> for use in web
maps in Mercator projection.  The coastline is usually the most important
element of maps at the lowest zoom levels so generalization is most important
here.</p>

<p>The technique used is a raster-based process implemented in the <a
href="https://github.com/imagico/coastline_gen">coastline_gen</a> tool. It
ensures that straits and land bridges are properly represented at the low
resolutions. Different levels of generalization are produced for the different
zoom levels up to z=8.</p>

</p>

<p>After the original coastline data processing two further steps are used:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any lakes tagged <tt>natural=coastline</tt> will be removed.</li>
<li>Some marine coastal water areas, primarily at the mouths of rivers, that
are not included in the coastline in OpenStreetMap are added based on the
<tt>maritime=yes</tt> tag.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rendering example</h2>

<p>Here an example of use of these coastlines - together with generalized
waterbodies and relief shading - from <a class="extlink"
