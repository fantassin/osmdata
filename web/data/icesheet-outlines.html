<h1>Antarctic icesheet outlines</h1>

<p>Linestrings for the outlines of the ice covered parts of the Antarctic that
are not explicitly mapped as glaciers in OpenStreetMap. Linestrings are split
into smaller chunks (no more than 200 km length in projected coordinates) that
are easier and faster to work with.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>These files are based on the OpenStreetMap data of land ice in the Antarctic
south of -60 degrees latitude which according to the <a class="extlink"
href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Antarctica/Tagging">OSM mapping
conventions for the Antarctic</a> is not represented by polygons. You need the
data here to properly render glaciers in the Antarctic in a map without special
local adaptations to your map style. <a href="/processing/icesheet.html">Learn more
about the Antarctic Icesheet processing...</a></p>

<p>The icesheet outlines in particular are needed if you render glaciers with
explicitly drawn outlines, otherwise you only need the <a
href="/data/icesheet-polygons.html">Antarctic icesheet polygons</a>.</p>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>The files contain an <em>ice_edge</em> attribute which can have three
different values with the following meaning:</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>ice_ocean</em> indicates outline segments separating ice from ocean</li>
    <li><em>ice_land</em> indicates outline segments separating ice from ice free land</li>
    <li><em>ice_ice</em> indicates outline segments separating implicit ice areas from glaciers explicitly mapped in OpenStreetMap</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using this data</h2>

<p>To use this data in an OpenStreetMap based map download the shapefile below,
include it as a separate layer in your map style and render features with
<tt>ice_edge=ice_ocean</tt> and <tt>ice_edge=ice_land</tt> with the same
styling as used for glacier outlines.</p>
