<h1>Generalized coastlines</h1>

<p>Linestrings of coastlines plus land and water polygons generalized for
rendering well readable maps at low zoom levels. Small details have been
removed while maintaining and enlarging key features.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <a href="/data/coast.html">original OpenStreetMap coastline data</a>
contains a lot of detail that badly affects readability of maps at coarse
scales.  In the files available here the geometries have been generalized to
remove small details unnecessary for rendering at these levels. <a
href="/processing/generalization.html">Learn more about coastline
generalization...</a></p>

<p>Generalization is specific for the map projection used - currently this is
available only in <a href="/info/projections.html#mercator">Mercator</a>
projection.</p>

<p>Note geometries in these files extend beyond the limits of the projection in
x-direction to allow seamless rendering of maps.  As a result these files
cannot be reprojected into other coordinate systems.</p>

<h2>Variants</h2>

<p>Land polygons, water polygons and coastlines are available separately. All
variants contain separate files with a level of generalization designed for a
certain web map zoom level. Due to processing details the land and water
polygons do not match exactly but the mismatch should usually be negligible at
the target zoom levels. The coastlines match the land polygons.</p>
